  <h3>Although I have only been in high school for just over a year, I have gained a lot. During my freshman year, I aquired the design thinking diploma. To gain this diploma, I had to go through all teh steps of design thinking to create projects. This year I am working towards gaining my inavaition diploma. To gain this diploma I need to help people fix a non simple problem. I am also in a club called Philanthropy. In this club we do community service. This consisted of beach clean ups, food drives and fundraisers.</h3>
